title: Statement
---
I have a strong desire to acquire skills and knowledge to practically apply computing principles, concepts, and technologies to deal with real-world problems. For instance: How can you better analyse end-user needs? How can you integrate technologies to build systems? How do you design useful and stable software?  Computing systems currently assist us to better read our social and economic reality to inform our decision-making processes and implement policies that help people to start and grow businesses.
Studying at DCI will enable me to develop technical and professional expertise in the key spheres of Technology. I want to use this to help establish analytical, evaluative, and problem-solving skills, in relation to Information Technology-based solutions.
